# check RStudio menu option "Code - Soft Wrap Long Lines"

# READ THE INSTRUCTIONS below!

# install recent versions of R and RStudio, open RStudio, then run the commands below, one at a time, to install the required packages

# it's preferable (often necessary) to have recent versions of all packages, so install even those you already had!

# if you get an error message about Rtools, follow the instructions in that message -- it may involve installing the Rtools software (outside R) and adding it to the path following the instructions in the link provided in the error message

# EVERY TIME you get an error message complaining about a package, install that package and try again

# after installing all packages, load each one with library() and check if there are additional error messages, in which case do as above
