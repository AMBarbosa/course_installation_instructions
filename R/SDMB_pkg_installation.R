# install recent versions of R and RStudio, then run the commands below to install the required packages

# install even packages you already had, as we'll need updated versions!

# if you get an error message about Rtools, follow the instructions in that message -- it may involve installing the Rtools software (outside R) and adding it to the path following the instructions in the link provided in the error message
